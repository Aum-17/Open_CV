# OpenCV Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains practical implementations of core **Computer Vision techniques** using **OpenCV (Python)** and the **OpenCV DNN module (SSD-based object detection)**.

The project covers both classical image processing methods and deep learning-based approaches for real-time image and video analysis.

## 🔍 Key Areas Covered

- Image Processing & Enhancement  
- Edge Detection & Filtering  
- Feature Detection (ORB) & Image Alignment  
- Panorama Stitching using Homography  
- HDR Imaging (Debevec Method & Tone Mapping)  
- Deep Learning Object Detection (SSD + DNN)  
- Object Tracking Algorithms (KCF, CSRT, MOSSE, etc.)  
- Pose & Face Detection  
- Video Processing & Camera Access  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 🎯 Objective

To build a strong foundation in practical computer vision systems by implementing real-world image and video processing pipelines from scratch.
